# Garmin Connect: Miles and Kilos

![Garmin Connect Chrome extension to display weight in kilograms while keeping distance in miles - runner on trail with kg scale](garmin-connect-miles-kg-converter.jpg)

**A tiny Chrome extension for runners who think in miles but weigh in kilograms.**

## The Itch

You run in miles. Maybe you're in the US, the UK, or just prefer the cadence of "6-minute miles" over "3:43 per kilometer."

But you also weigh yourself in kilograms. Because that's what your scale shows. Or because you moved countries. Or because 75 sounds better than 165.

Garmin Connect gives you two choices:

| Setting | Distance   | Weight    |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Statute | Miles      | Pounds    |
| Metric  | Kilometers | Kilograms |

Pick one. Suffer.

**Until now.**

## The Fix

Install this extension. Go to Garmin Connect. See your weight in kg. Keep your mile splits. That's it.

- **Zero config** - Install and forget
- **Body weight + exercise weights** - Converts lbs to kg everywhere
- **Works everywhere** - Charts, tables, popups, tooltips
- **Privacy-first** - Runs locally, sends nothing anywhere

## Install (1 minute)

3. Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top right corner)
